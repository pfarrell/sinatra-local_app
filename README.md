# Sinatra::LocalApp

A Sinatra extension that will recognize if your request could be redirected to a local network location.

Why? Let's say you run applications on your home network... why use the infrastructure of the internet when
your requests could be serviced locally?  Why, indeed...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sinatra-local_app'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sinatra-local_app

## Usage

Register like a typical Sinatra extension
