# Sinatra::Presence

A Sinatra extension that will recognize if your request could be redirected to a local network location.

Why? 

Let's say you run applications on your home network... why use the infrastructure of the internet when
your requests could be serviced locally?  

Why, indeed...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sinatra-presence'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sinatra-presence

## Usage

Register like a typical Sinatra extension
